# eNet: an algorithm to build enhancer networks based on scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data
## Introduction
eNet is an algorithm designed to integrate single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles and build enhancer networks, delineating how multiple enhancers interact with each other in gene regulation.
